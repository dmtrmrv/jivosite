== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not include JivoSite code in a theme directly? =

Because if you change the theme JivoSite code will be gone as well. With this plugin, code will stay on your website regardless of the theme.

= Where do I get my widget id? =

You can get **widget id** in your JivoSite admin panel at [jivosite.ru](http://jivosite.ru/) or [jivochat.com](http://jivochat.com/). See [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jivosite/screenshots/) for details.
